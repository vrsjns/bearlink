# Auth Service Hardening

> **Status:** approved
> **Service(s):** auth-service, shared, web-ui
> **Priority:** critical

## Goal

The auth-service has several security gaps that make it unsuitable for production: JWTs
are stored in localStorage (XSS-vulnerable), secrets are hardcoded in version control,
failed login attempts have no lockout, and there is no CSRF protection once cookies are
introduced. This spec closes those gaps.

## Background

Current state:
- `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret` is committed to `docker-compose.yml`
- The frontend stores JWTs in `localStorage`, accessible to any injected script
- The `DELETE /users/:userId` endpoint has no error handling (no try/catch, no 404 check)
- There is no account lockout after repeated failed logins

## Requirements

### Functional

- **R1:** On successful login, the auth-service shall set the JWT as an `httpOnly`,
  `Secure` (in production), `SameSite=strict` cookie named `token`. The response body
  shall return user data but not the token string.
- **R2:** The auth-service shall expose `POST /logout` which clears the `token` cookie
  and returns 204.
- **R3:** The shared `authenticateJWT` middleware shall read the token from the `token`
  cookie first, falling back to the `Authorization: Bearer` header for API clients.
- **R4:** The web-ui shall use `withCredentials: true` on all Axios requests. All
  `localStorage` token read/write logic shall be removed.
- **R5:** All secret values (`JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.) shall be sourced from
  environment variables or a `.env.secrets` file that is not committed to git.
  `docker-compose.yml` shall use `env_file` to reference this file.
- **R6:** `DELETE /users/:userId` shall validate the userId, return 404 if the user does
  not exist, return 400 if an admin attempts to delete their own account, and wrap the
  operation in a try/catch with structured error logging.
- **R7:** After 5 consecutive failed login attempts for an email address, the auth-service
  shall return 429 for that email for 15 minutes. A successful login resets the counter.
- **R8:** The auth-service shall expose `GET /csrf-token` which returns a CSRF token.
  All state-mutating endpoints (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) shall validate the
  `X-CSRF-Token` header when cookie auth is in use.

### Non-Functional

- **R9:** The account lockout store may be in-memory for now (single instance). It shall
  be extracted behind an interface so it can be swapped for Redis later.
- **R10:** Cookie configuration shall be driven by `NODE_ENV`: `Secure` flag only in
  production, to allow HTTP in local development.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] After login, the response sets a `Set-Cookie: token=...;HttpOnly` header.
- [ ] The response body after login does not contain a `token` field.
- [ ] `POST /logout` clears the `token` cookie and returns 204.
- [ ] `GET /profile` succeeds when the JWT is sent via cookie (no Authorization header).
- [ ] The web-ui makes requests without reading from or writing to `localStorage`.
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` does not contain any literal secret values.
- [ ] `DELETE /users/:userId` with a non-existent ID returns 404.
- [ ] `DELETE /users/:userId` where the target is the authenticated admin returns 400.
- [ ] After 5 failed login attempts, a 6th attempt with the correct password returns 429.
- [ ] After a successful login, a subsequent failed login resets and does not immediately
  lock the account.
- [ ] A POST request without a valid CSRF token returns 403 when using cookie auth.

## Out of Scope

- OAuth / SSO integration
- Refresh token rotation
- Password reset / forgot-password flow
- Two-factor authentication
- Migrating existing sessions (users will need to log in again after deployment)
